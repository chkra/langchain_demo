# Code from LangChain tutorial


![](./01_simple_bot/state_graph.png)


This very simple repository collects basic code from a [introductory course on LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/why-langgraph/). We highly recommend working on this tutorial, this repo is just a shortcut to collect the full running code from the first steps.

There are sepecific simple README.md files in each subfolder, mostly referring to the according tutorial. To get each code example running, you may require one or more API keys. You can get those keys by registering with the respoectiv platforms - all examples here should be accessible without paying any money. Place them the keys locally in the following files in this repo (they are under .gitignore):

* anthropic_api_key.txt
* tavily_api_key.txt
* langsmith_api_key.txt
